# Xinshuo's Python Toolbox
A Python toolbox that contains common help functions for **stream I/O**, **mathematics**, **image & video processing** and **visualization**, which is generally useful for data processing in computer vision and machine learning. Most project code that I have released depends on this toolbox.

#### Usage:

*1. clone the github repository.*
~~~shell
git clone https://github.com/xinshuoweng/xinshuo_toolbox
~~~

*2. install dependency for the toolbox.*
~~~shell
cd xinshuo_toolbox
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

*3. The index to the available functions will be coming soon.*

#### End
